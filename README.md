Multi-Capture & Forced Multi-Capture:
Implemented rules force players to continue capturing if available. If a capture is possible, the move is enforcedâ€”demonstrating robust multi-capture logic.

Burned Pieces:
When a move is made without capturing despite an available capture opportunity, the piece is "burned" as a penalty, adding an extra layer of strategy.

Simultaneous Games:
Multiple game instances can be played concurrently on the same screen. Each game is fully independent, allowing for side-by-side play.

Drag-and-Drop Interface:
Intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for moving pieces makes the game interactive and user-friendly.

Responsive & Modular Design:
The UI and game logic are completely decoupled, making it easy to maintain and extend. The board scales to fit different screen sizes, and the code structure supports adding new features easily.
